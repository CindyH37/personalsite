These are the languages that I speak: fluent English, disastrous Mandarin, American-accented French, and three words each of Spanish and Italian. The first four I actually have taken classes for; the last one is because I was briefly obsessed with Ludovico Einaudi for a few weeks earlier this year. I bring this up again because I just finished part one of Elizabeth Gilber's Eat, Pray, Love, where she spends four months in Italy doing nothing more than talk to strangers to find the best food in the area and then go eat it. I'm surprised she only gained 23 pounds.

I've had plenty of time to ponder the various mysteries of life while sorting through never-ending stacks of paper at my parents' office. And since I'll be going off to college in the fall, I've embarked on a last-ditch effort to learn a little more Chinese. (I wouldn't say it's going well, but it's going.)

## An Opinion

Of all the languages I've come across, Chinese is the most beautiful. And I have two main reasons why.

1. It's efficient. Because Chinese uses tones, we can say much more in a few syllables than most letter-based languages can. While the words of other languages get longer, Chinese characters get more intricate. (Hippopotame vs. hippopotamus vs. 河马.) Plus, Chinese doesn't worry about ridiculously long irregular verb endings. (J'aille, tu ailles, ... nous allions?)

2. It's visual. The Chinese character for "person," 人, actually has two legs. Can you say the same for English? As for French, care to explain why someone decided to tack an extra "ne" on the end to make it "personne" and then arbitrarily decide that despite the fact that most of the world has and continues to be a patriarchy, French nouns necessitate genders and "personne" must be feminine?

## The Word Herd

I like collecting words. I started doing this over a year ago for a poetry class at school, and I kind of let that fall to the wayside once that ended, but I've gotten back to it recently.

My collection of pretty English words so far:

- Dreamscape
- Transcend
- Cloudberry
- Seek

My collection of pretty Chinese words so far:

- 金秋
- 岁月
- 淡雅

My collection of pretty French words so far:

- I haven't exactly gotten here yet.

## Is this about to become a language blog?

I don't know. I just write whatever I feel like writing on here. Next time I might write about how I want to decorate my dorm room or rant about picking classes for college. It depends on how I feel at that moment.

## Math Stuffs

My interview for <a href="https://espr-camp.org/" target="_blank" rel="nonreferrer noreferrer">ESPR</a>{' '} a few days ago went well. I was really nervous logging on but it soon became clear that my interviewer had no patience for fluff, so at that point the interview turned into a scholarly discussion.

I did not solve the initial application question, so I was surprised when I received the interview request. But I don't think my interviewer minded. We had a very intellectual discussion of a bunch of topics.

My interview went over by 45 minutes, and I left feeling hopeful. The politely firm disagreements, counterarguments, and follow-up questions were unlike anything I'd ever experienced talking to my teachers at school.

In the fall, I will most likely retake multivariable calculus. I didn't want to skip it because I feel like there's a lot I missed out on the first time through, and I'd also like to not kill myself via unmanageable workload my first semester of college. So that's that.
