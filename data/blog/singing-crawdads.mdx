I wanted to see Where the Crawdads Sing ever since I found out that it was becoming a movie. I haven't read the book (and I fell asleep listening to it during my last road trip with my family), but I still really wanted to see the movie. The cover was beautiful, the title was beautiful, and Taylor Swift even wrote a beautiful song for it.

But during the days leading up to the movie I started to have second thoughts - what if it would be really creepy? What if it just plain sucked? The reason why I hadn't read the book yet was because I knew Kya's story would be lonely, and I am currently not in need of any extra loneliness in my life. I'm also generally not a fan of lonely books. Like History of Wolves by Emily Fridlund, which I gave up because it was just too depressing.

## The Actual Movie

So movie day arrived, I got there with my family, and we ordered extra-expensive movie theater food because why not? And the movie was so good. It was beautiful, as I'd expected, especially in terms of imagery. I like natural settings: sunsets, marshes, lakes, oceans. And even though Kya leads a very different life from me, I still understood her. (I did not get this feeling listening to the audiobook, where I mostly just felt annoyed at the narrator's fake-falsetto voice that was supposed to represent child-Kya.)

In a vague sense, the movie was poetic. It wasn't scary at all, despite being half murder-mystery. Plus, several of the characters were quite likeable despite being flawed. I think that's the most important part of character development - to write a character with depth, who makes mistakes yet is still empathizable.

So I continue to believe that Where the Crawdads Sing is a good movie. It's definitely my favorite one of the year. I would say it's my favorite ever, but I don't watch that many movies to begin with so I'm not sure if that would be fair.

## Other Things

The main event of my day today was the movie. After that, I went to a gelato shop to catch up with a friend who works there. (I got pistachio. It was good. And I also learned that the difference between gelato and ice cream is that gelato is apparently creamier.)

Then I went to a local garden with my parents. Let's just say that July is not peak blooming period. But it was still nice to look at the plants and wander the paths.

And so begins my quest to make my life more interesting. Tomorrow I'll be visiting yet another local garden, but this one actually requires tickets so hopefully it will be worth the money. Then I'll have one more week to spend at home before I leave for WiSE and turn 18 along the way.
