## How I Got Here

To be honest, my decision to sign up for Startup School was pretty arbitrary. When I first heard about it, my summer was looking pretty unscheduled (read: boring) and I wanted something possibly interesting to do. So although I can barely code and haven't even started college yet, I registered for the online program.

I didn't really take the program seriously. I've done plenty of online classes in the past, and I never found them to be as effective as I would've liked. So I thought I'd just stick around for a little bit and then leave when I got bored.

## The Outcome

I did end up sticking around for the entire program, and it was worth it. If anything, I'm now much more aware of what's actually going on in the world of startups. I also feel much more grown up now :)

## Priorities Moving forward

I most likely won't be dropping out of college to become the next Alexandr Wang. (I don't think I'm that kind of person.) But for now, Startup School has helped me decide that I should be focusing on these things:

### 1. Seek out interesting people.

This sounds really weird because who am I to decide if someone's interesting or not? That's not exactly what I'm going for. My point is that I want to meet some new people who have varied interests - people I feel like I'd learn from just by spending time with them.

And hopefully, the same will be true for people who talk to me. I don't really like idle small talk because it feels like I'm exerting a lot of effort but not getting anywhere. Sigh.

### 2. Explore everything.

This one's a no-brainer. I mean, isn't that kind of the point of college? But I feel like I'm already failing at this because there are so many classes I want to take and I only get 4 per semester. 5 if I can handle it, but I don't think I'll be taking 5 as a first-semester freshman.

Still, at the very least I'm planning to take a Chinese course because I want to spend a summer in China. I've spent my whole life feeling caught in between two cultures, and up until now, it was always easier for me to just "avoid being Chinese" as much as possible. I don't want to do that anymore, because I know I'm not fooling anyone.

### 3. Maybe actually possibly learn to code.

I've been trying to learn to code for about 5 years and never managed to maintain focus long enough to complete a project. So I never got past for loops in Java and Python. Now, I suppose this site is kind of a coding project, but I definitely need to upgrade my skills if I want to actually be useful. So that's that.

## Other Stuff

This was a sad post. It's funny how when I have so much going on in my life I end up having less to say. I'm so overwhelmed by college prep and everything.
