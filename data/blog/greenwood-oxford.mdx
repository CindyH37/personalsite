## Greenwood

It was stunning and I would absolutely go again. But I couldn't help thinking that I prefer gardens that don't make me pay in blood. So if I do go again, I will not leave the house without an extra bottle of bug spray. Or three.

Out of all the gardens I've been to (I think I've been to more than the average 17-year-old girl), this one and Longwood are my favorites. Longwood would probably take the prize, but it's been years since I went there and I don't remember it that well.

Still, Greenwood was very green and very nice. There were fluttery butterflies and croaky frogs that would aggressively jump into the pond when you got too close. I usually didn't even see them until they were already in the water. So I don't think the jumping-into-water part was especially beneficial to their survival.

## Photography

I have no formal photography training. I don't even own a camera, save for the one on my iPhone. So I use that to edit my photos. It's fun. I have no idea if they're any good, but I like them. Scroll to the bottom of this to see my collage of Greenwood photos.

So Williams has a couple of photography clubs I'm thinking of joining.

## ESPR and WiSE

These will be taking up the rest of my summer. Well, not all of it. But a good chunk of it.

WiSE starts on Sunday, so I'll be in Manhattan for a few days learning about what exactly Jane Street does and whether or not I want to be a part of it. I don't have specific expectations for this, I just want to meet some new people and have a decently non-disastrous 18th birthday while I'm there. If I have the time, I'd like to blog daily during the program. (Which is only 2 days, anyway.)

ESPR stands for "European Summer Program in Rationality" or something like that. It's 10 days in August, and I'll be staying at Queens College, a constituent college of Oxford University. I'm excited and terrified because a) I didn't solve the application question and still haven't and b) I might end up flying alone, which I've never done. I've only ever gone abroad with my family and on school trips.

Also, I've been having serious doubts about my ability to keep up with the program. Impostor syndrome struck really hard the night I got my acceptance letter, and my mind has been short circuiting - what do the ESPR staff see in me? I know no graph theory, group theory, game theory, or any theories in general. During my interview, my interviewer and I talked about Bayes' Theorem for 10 minutes despite me not understanding it. My single claim to fame was having read all of GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, in a month...is that what they found impressive about me?

I remember filling out the confirmation form that very night because I was so scared it would disappear if I waited until the next morning. Which is ironic considering this is a rationality program and logic generally tells you that emails don't just disappear. But logic also tells me that there are many people who are more qualified than me to do a program like this.
