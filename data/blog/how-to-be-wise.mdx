TLDR: It was definitely worth the time. Skip to the end for takeaways.

## Day 0 (Arrival Day)

This was probably the worst day of the program. I arrived at the hotel with zero knowledge of what would be ahead of me. I didn’t know anyone there, I didn’t know how many people there would be, and I didn’t even have a program schedule.

Dinner was vaguely traumatic. I made up my mind to learn people’s names and say hi to them no matter how awkward it was, so I did exactly that. And ended up at a full table of Penn students. I was hoping for a program where I’d be able to meet other girls who also liked math-y things, but I still felt super out of place. (I ended up being the only Williams student out of the 80+ girls there, and most of them were MIT/Harvard/Penn.)

I didn’t sleep well that night.

## Day 1

We had several lectures that day, the most memorable one of which was on OCaml, a programming language that barely anyone uses. This should have been interesting, except that they neglected to account for the fact that not everyone has CS knowledge. I got lost as soon as they started discussing type systems.

The hands-on activities we did were 1) probability and expected value questions and 2) a Jane-Street-invented card game called Figgie. I loved both of these. In the past, I’ve always hated probability because I always managed to convince myself that my entirely flawed reasoning was correct, but this time, I just thought it was cool. It felt elegant, even considering the fact that my table solved less than half of the questions we were given. And we had help.

Figgie had a steep learning curve for me. I don’t have much experience playing cards, so I was very much intimidated at first. Basically, Figgie uses its own card deck. The premise of the game involves trading cards with other players in order to accumulate the most cards of the “goal suit.” But no one knows what the goal suit is, because it depends on the distribution of the other cards, which you can’t tell since you can’t look at other players’ hands.

The first game we played, everyone just kind of stared at one another being totally confused. But by the fourth round, I started to get the hang of it and won $160 (fake dollars) at the end. That was one of the best parts of that day.

In the evening they took us to see Wicked. I can’t remember if I’ve seen a Broadway show before this, so all of this was new to me. It was very dramatic, very musical, and I loved getting to actually see someone sing Defying Gravity live.

I slept very well that night.

## Day 2

Was my birthday and the best day of the program. I tried to not have expectations for this day because my birthdays are usually just ordinary days, so I didn’t tell that many people.

The morning lecture, heuristics and biases, was my favorite lecture of the program. I think I spoke up three times during that, which is a lot since I don’t think I’ve ever spoken up in a lecture in my entire life.

After the lecture we had Figgie-based math questions, which were extraordinarily hard. My table didn’t get very far, but I liked discussing them, especially with the help of one of the traders.

During our lunch block, we got a tour of the rest of the office. Jane Street asked us not to take pictures because they’re so secretive, but it was really nice. Fancy facilities and beautiful furniture and everything looked like snow-white marble. Plus they’ve got “quiet rooms” for meditation.

The last activity of the program was the Estimathon, which I was not a fan of. I simply had no idea how to estimate the cost of taxidermy-ing a rhino. Out of all the activities, I was probably the least engaged in this one. Yet somehow my table finished 3rd out of 14? I take no credit whatsoever.

In the evening, I went with a group of girls to SoHo, a nearby neighborhood with shops and restaurants. We took the subway there, which was entirely intimidating. Then we went to Aritzia (meh), BoCaphe (Vietnamese food - yay), Miniso (best part of the night), and Muji (meh).

Miniso is this Japanese store that sells “lifestyle products” (read: stuffed animals and stationery). I’d never been there and had never heard of it, so I had no expectations. But the one we went to was piled floor to ceiling with the cutest stuffed animals I’d ever seen. I got myself a sushi cat as a birthday present. I think I’m gonna give it a name and bring it to college with me.

I would have had a good night’s sleep with my sushi cat, but alas, the girls next door were singing karaoke at 1 am. I could hear every word of Let it Go, Defying Gravity, and You Are the Reason. So instead of sleeping, my sushi cat and I had some good bonding time. (P.S. I'm gonna name her Mallow because she looks like a marshmallow.)

## Takeaways

Now that I’ve finished rambling, here are my main takeaways from the program. I think some of them will transfer over to college and they’re not all Jane Street-specific.

1. Probability, stats, and CS are useful for life as a trader. I’ll see if I can get into a probability class at Williams, since I really liked the probability activities we did at WiSE. As for CS, the language you learn isn’t all that important as long as you build things. If you end up at Jane Street, they’ll teach you OCaml.
2. I’m considering interning at Jane Street the summer after my sophomore year. Their applications open one year before, so I’ll have to look into that next summer. But this isn’t make-or-break to me. I’d like to intern at a bunch of different places so I get a better sense of the careers available to me.
3. WiSE was a great time for me to practice asking good questions. It sounds silly, but I don’t ask many questions at school. I’ve always been more of a passive listener, but I didn’t want to do that anymore because I knew it would put me to sleep. So I made it a goal to ask one question at every activity, which I did with about a 75% success rate. This was good.
4. I’m finally making progress on not always ending up alone during unstructured free time! I’m bad at socializing. But I’m estimating that I’ve “officially met” 2-3 dozen girls during the two-day program. That’s probably more than the number of people I’ve talked to during the entire school year last year. And I’m pretty glad I went to SoHo last night rather than staying in my hotel room. That’s what I was expecting when everyone started forming their own social circles, so it was nice that things didn’t actually end up that way. The sushi cat was the ultimate bonus.
