I'm a first-year student at Williams College, originally from New Jersey. I attended high school at the Montclair Kimberley Academy where I headed the math club and played varsity ice hockey.

Random things I like include:

- Long one-on-one conversations
- Watercolor florals and pastel colors
- Stuffed animals, swing sets, and picture books
- Sitting on tables and writing on whiteboards
- Fall foliage (which I get plenty of in MA)
- Snow days (which I sadly no longer get)
- Thunderstorms
- Koi ponds
